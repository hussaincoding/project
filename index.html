                <h1>Web Design & Development</h1>
                <span>I don't just design websites. I build high-performing, beautiful websites that are
                    conversion-focused, brand-accurate, and user-friendly.</span>

                    <span>Catch the eye. In addition to web services, I can produce branding and marketing resources for
                        both print and digital applications.</span>

                <h1>SEO</h1>
                <span>A greater audience. A high converting website won't be effective if no one visits it. Ranking on
                    Google is essential to getting new clients in the door.</span>

                    <h1>
                        Photo & Video</h1>
                    <span>Show, don't tell. Photos and videos are effective at telling the story of who you are and what
                        you do, establishing trust, and building relationships with potential customers.</span>

                <h1>Discovery</h1>
                <span>This is the phase where I dive deep into your world and get to know you. Before I can properly
                    design your high-performing website, I need to understand you, your pain-points, and your
                    audience.</span>

                <h1>Design</h1>
                <span>I take what I’ve learned about you & craft a bespoke website that’s tailored to meet your unique
                    needs, all while accurately representing your brand & keeping things aesthetically pleasing &
                    useable for your audience.</span>

                </h1>
                <h1>Build</h1>
                <span>Once you’re happy with the designs, I will proceed to building them making sure everything is
                    optimised to follow modern web practices, such as speed, security and reliability.</span>
                <h1>

                <h1>Launch</h1>
                <span>After I’ve completed the build and double checked everything alongside your approval, it’s time to
                    launch your website. In this phase I will also provide some training videos on how you can add
                    content to your website so you can do it yourself.</span>
